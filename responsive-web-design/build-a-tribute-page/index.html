			<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's life:</h2>
			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><b>1857</b> - Tsiolkovsky was born in Izhevskoye, in the Russian Empire, to a middle-class family.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1892</b> - During this period, Tsiolkovsky began working on a problem that would occupy much of his time during the coming years: an attempt to build an all-metal dirigible that could be expanded or shrunk in size. Tsiolkovsky developed the first aerodynamics laboratory in Russia in his apartment.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1896</b> - Tsiolkovsky systematically studied the theory of motion of rocket apparatus. Thoughts on the use of the rocket principle in the cosmos were expressed by him as early as 1883, and a rigorous theory of rocket propulsion was developed in 1896. Tsiolkovsky derived the formula, which he called the "formula of aviation".</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1897</b> - He built the first Russian wind tunnel with an open test section and developed a method of experimentation using it.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1900</b> - With a grant from the Academy of Sciences, he made a survey using models of the simplest shapes and determined the drag coefficients of the sphere, flat plates, cylinders, cones, and other bodies. Tsiolkovsky's work in the field of aerodynamics was a source of ideas for Russian scientist Nikolay Zhukovsky, the father of modern aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. Tsiolkovsky described the airflow around bodies of different geometric shapes, but because the RPCS did not provide any financial support for this project, he was forced to pay for it largely out of his own pocket.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1903</b> - His most important work, published in May 1903, was Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices. Tsiolkovsky calculated, using the Tsiolkovsky equation, that the horizontal speed required for a minimal orbit around the Earth is 8,000 m/s (5 miles per second) and that this could be achieved by means of a multistage rocket fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. In the article "Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices", it was suggested for the first time that a rocket could perform space flight. In this article and its sequels (1911 and 1914), he developed some ideas of missiles and considered the use of liquid rocket engines.<br>
					The outward appearance of Tsiolkovsky's spacecraft design, published in 1903, was a basis for modern spaceship design. The design had a hull divided into three main sections. The pilot and copilot were in the first section, the second and third sections held the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen needed to fuel the spacecraft.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1929</b> - In 1926–1929, Tsiolkovsky solved the practical problem regarding the role played by rocket fuel in getting to escape velocity and leaving the Earth. He showed that the final speed of the rocket depends on the rate of gas flowing from it and on how the weight of the fuel relates to the weight of the empty rocket. Tsiolkovsky proposed the construction of multistage rockets in his book Space Rocket Trains</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1935</b> - Tsiolkovsky died in Kaluga on 19 September 1935 after undergoing an operation for stomach cancer. He bequeathed his life's work to the Soviet state.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1989</b> - Tsiolkovsky was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.</li>
				<br>

			<p class="font"><i>Tsiolkovsky is customary to be called, for the absence of a different definition, inventor. He was, however, the inventor is not in the usual sense of the word. His activity did not have time to bring tactile fruits, which would be entered into our daily life... the works of Tsiolkovsky will take advantage of future generations. He is the Creator of bold plans, a wonderful technical thinker, one of the greatest in our Union.</i>
